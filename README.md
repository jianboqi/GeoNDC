Key Features:
🌍 Continuous 4D Reconstruction: Query surface reflectance at any coordinate $(x, y)$ and any time $t$.

☁️ Cloud-Robust: Implicitly handles missing data and cloud occlusions via neural inpainting.dy/dt Differentiable Physics: Supports analytical computation of 1st and 2nd order temporal derivatives for extracting precise vegetation dynamics.

🚀 High Fidelity: Preserves high-frequency details often lost in traditional temporal smoothing.
