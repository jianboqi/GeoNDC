Key Features:

🌍 Continuous 4D Reconstruction: Query surface reflectance at any coordinate $(x, y)$ and any time $t$.

☁️ Cloud-Robust: Implicitly handles missing data and cloud occlusions via neural inpainting.

📈 y/dt Differentiable Physics: Supports analytical computation of derivatives for extracting precise surface dynamics.

🚀 High Fidelity: Preserves high-frequency details often lost in traditional temporal smoothing.
